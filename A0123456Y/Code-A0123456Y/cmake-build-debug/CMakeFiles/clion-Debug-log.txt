DEBUG Build Type

CMake Warning (dev) at /Applications/CLion.app/Contents/bin/cmake/mac/share/cmake-3.24/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:438 (message):
  The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args` (AUTOTESTER)
  does not match the name of the calling package (Autotester).  This can lead
  to problems in calling code that expects `find_package` result variables
  (e.g., `_FOUND`) to follow a certain pattern.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  cmake/FindAutotester.cmake:33 (find_package_handle_standard_args)
  CMakeLists.txt:39 (find_package)
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
